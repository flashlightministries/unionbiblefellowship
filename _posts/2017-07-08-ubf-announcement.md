We're a group of local families who gather together to share meals and learn about Jesus Christ.  Believers and seekers alike are welcome to join us as we spend time talking about the gospel, praying and worshipping God.

First-time attendees need not bring any food.  After that, please bring a dish to share.  We provide Bibles if you need them.

We're independent and unaffiliated with any church denomination.  Rest assured that this is not a sect or a cult.  We affirm that the Bible alone is the inspired word of God and the sole authority for doctrine.

For meeting times and location, call brother TC at (541) 786-6456 or email tc@unionbiblefellowship.org.

God bless, and we hope to see you soon!
